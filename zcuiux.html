    <p style="font-weight: bold;"> User experience design (UX design, UXD, UED, or XD) : </p>
        <p>It is the process of defining the experience a user
         would go through when interacting with a company, its services, and its products.[1] Design decisions in 
         UX design are often driven by research, data analysis, and test results rather than aesthetic preferences
         and opinions. Unlike user interface design, which focuses solely on the design of a computer interface ,
         UX design encompasses all aspects of a user's perceived experience with a product or website, such as its
         usability, usefulness, desirability, brand perception, and overall performance.UX design is also an element
         of the customer experience (CX), which encompasses all aspects and stages of a customer's experience and
         interaction with a company </p> <br>
         
         <p style="font-weight: bold;">User interface (UI) design or user interface engineering :</p>
          <p>It is the design of user interfaces for machines 
         and software, such as computers, home appliances, mobile devices, and other electronic devices, with the
         focus on maximizing usability and the user experience. In computer or software design, user interface (UI)
         design primarily focuses on information architecture. It is the process of building interfaces that clearly
         communicates to the user what's important. UI design refers to graphical user interfaces and other forms
         of interface design. The goal of user interface design is to make the user's interaction as simple and
         efficient as possible, in terms of accomplishing user goals (user-centered design).
