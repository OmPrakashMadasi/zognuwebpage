    <h2 style="color: brown; font-weight: bold;"> Human Resources Manager </h2>

    <p> Heads of HR are required in almost all sectors and industries. In this senior role you must embody
         the business’s culture, being responsible for the wellbeing of the workforce and attracting new talent.

        Your responsibilities centre on leading the HR department processes and driving people management 
        strategies. This includes, coaching, mentoring and supporting staff members to identify their individual
         strengths and development needs, while championing an open, embracing culture of Diversity, Equity and 
         Inclusion (DEI) throughout the organisation. You will also ensure that the human resources programs and
          initiatives are implemented effectively and efficiently. 
        
        With the onset of the pandemic in 2020, and to successfully support the vast changes to the way people
         work, the role of Head of HR evolved dramatically. During this time HR functions made huge adjustments 
         to business strategies, including adapting systems and tools to work from home, changes to priorities,
          budgets, headcount and the introduction of the furlough scheme. 
        We may see further developments to this role, as Heads of HR deal with new responsibilities and stark
         changes to their teams and working culture, for example mass redundancies, or recruiting new staff in 
         line with revised business focus and priorities.</p><br>
